In this memoir, Russ inspires readers to walk to their individual rhythms and beat their biggest obstacles: themselves.<br /><br />With chapters named after his most powerful and popular songs,&#xa0;IT'S ALL IN YOUR HEAD&#xa0;will reflect on the lessons he’s learned from his career, family, and relationships. He’ll push readers to bet on themselves, take those leaps of faith, and recognize struggles as opportunities.&#xa0;IT'S ALL IN YOUR HEAD&#xa0;will give readers an inside-look at the man and the motivation behind the music. A lover of books like&#xa0;The Alchemist&#xa0;and&#xa0;The Seven Spiritual Laws of Success, Russ delivers a short, potent, inspirational, raw, and honest book that gives readers a way to find self-belief and unlock their potential.

That was clear to then-Captain Rusty Bradley as he began his third tour of duty there in 2006. The Taliban and their allies were infiltrating everywhere, poised to reclaim Kandahar Province, their strategically vital onetime capital. To stop them, the NATO coalition launched Operation Medusa, the largest offensive in its history. The battlefield was the Panjwayi Valley, a densely packed warren of walled compounds that doubled neatly as enemy bunkers, lush orchards, and towering marijuana stands, laced through with treacherous irrigation ditches. A mass exodus of civilians heralded the carnage to come. <br /><br />Dispatched as a diversionary force in support of the main coalition attack, Bradley’s Special Forces A-team and two others, along with their longtime Afghan Army allies, watched from across the valley as the NATO force was quickly engulfed in a vicious counterattack. Key to relieving it and calling in effective air strikes was possession of a modest patch of high ground called Sperwan Ghar. Bradley’s small detachment assaulted the hill and, in the midst of a savage and unforgettable firefight, soon learned they were facing nearly a thousand seasoned fighters - from whom they seized an impossible victory. <br /><br />Now Bradley recounts the whole remarkable story as it actually happened. The blistering trek across Afghanistan’s infamous Red Desert. The eerie traces of the elusive Taliban. The close relations with the Afghan people and army, a primary mission focus. Sperwan Ghar itself: unremitting waves of fire from machine guns and rocket-propelled grenades; a targeted truck turned into an inferno; the death trap of a cut-off compound. Most important: the men, Americans and Afghans alike - the “shaky” medic with nerves of steel and a surgeon’s hands in battle; the tireless sergeant who seems to be everywhere at once; the soft-spoken intelligence officer with laser-sharp insight; the diminutive Afghan commander with a Goliath-sized heart; the cool maverick who risks all to rescue a grievously wounded comrade - each unique, all indelible in their everyday exercise of extraordinary heroism."},{"wrapperType":"audiobook","artistId":394418750,"collectionId":866796886,"artistName":"Steven Furtick","collectionName":"Crash the Chatterbox: Hearing God's Voice Above All Others (Unabridged)","collectionCensoredName":"Crash the Chatterbox: Hearing God's Voice Above All Others (Unabridged)","artistViewUrl":"https://books.apple.com/us/author/steven-furtick/id394418750?uo=4","collectionViewUrl":"https://books.apple.com/us/audiobook/crash-the-chatterbox-hearing-gods-voice-above-all/id866796886?uo=4","artworkUrl60":"https://is2-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music123/v4/9a/3c/1e/9a3c1ef0-ec87-c305-ac9a-cb6d97e27abd/rm_image.jpg/60x60bb.jpg","artworkUrl100":"https://is2-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music123/v4/9a/3c/1e/9a3c1ef0-ec87-c305-ac9a-cb6d97e27abd/rm_image.jpg/100x100bb.jpg","collectionPrice":17.99,"collectionExplicitness":"notExplicit","trackCount":1,"copyright":"© 2014 Elevation Church","country":"USA","currency":"USD","releaseDate":"2014-04-10T07:00:00Z","primaryGenreName":"Religion & Spirituality","previewUrl":"https://audio-ssl.itunes.apple.com/itunes-assets/AudioPreview123/v4/e6/4c/c6/e64cc62d-92b7-dbdb-57ac-b57a7c3214f8/mzaf_7928912910719925494.std.aac.p.m4a","description":"Crashing the chatterbox = Overpowering lies of insecurity, fear, condemnation, and discouragement with the promises of God. <br /><br />“I used to think that someone who struggled with the kinds of weaknesses I deal with daily was useless to God.

The pass was intercepted and the Seahawks lost. Critics called it the dumbest play in history. But was the call really that bad? Or did Carroll actually make a great move that was ruined by bad luck?<br /><br />Even the best decision doesn't yield the best outcome every time. There's always an element of luck that you can't control, and there is always information that is hidden from view. So the key to long-term success (and avoiding worrying yourself to death) is to think in bets: How sure am I? What are the possible ways things could turn out? What decision has the highest odds of success? Did I land in the unlucky 10% on the strategy that works 90% of the time? Or is my success attributable to dumb luck rather than great decision making? <br /><br />Annie Duke, a former World Series of Poker champion turned business consultant, draws on examples from business, sports, politics, and (of course) poker to share tools anyone can use to embrace uncertainty and make better decisions. For most people, it's difficult to say \"I'm not sure\" in a world that values and, even, rewards the appearance of certainty. But professional poker players are comfortable with the fact that great decisions don't always lead to great outcomes and bad decisions don't always lead to bad outcomes.<br /><br />By shifting your thinking from a need for certainty to a goal of accurately assessing what you know and what you don't, you'll be less vulnerable to reactive emotions, knee-jerk biases, and destructive habits in your decision making. You'll become more confident, calm, compassionate and successful in the long run."},{"wrapperType":"audiobook","artistId":524159409,"collectionId":1130547805,"artistName":"Bryn Greenwood","collectionName":"All the Ugly and Wonderful Things: A Novel (Unabridged)","collectionCensoredName":"All the Ugly and Wonderful Things: A Novel (Unabridged)","artistViewUrl":"https://books.apple.com/us/author/bryn-greenwood/id524159409?uo=4","collectionViewUrl":"https://books.apple.com/us/audiobook/all-the-ugly-and-wonderful-things-a-novel-unabridged/id1130547805?uo=4","artworkUrl60":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music123/v4/c7/b0/a7/c7b0a721-9123-f910-2655-aa6f221bcab6/rm_image.jpg/60x60bb.jpg","artworkUrl100":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music123/v4/c7/b0/a7/c7b0a721-9123-f910-2655-aa6f221bcab6/rm_image.jpg/100x100bb.jpg","collectionPrice":11.99,"collectionExplicitness":"notExplicit","trackCount":1,"copyright":"© 2016 Audible Studios","country":"USA","currency":"USD","releaseDate":"2016-08-09T07:00:00Z","primaryGenreName":"Fiction","previewUrl":"https://audio-ssl.itunes.apple.com/itunes-assets/AudioPreview123/v4/42/7a/6d/427a6d1f-0905-f6eb-dd29-ccfe1a556c3e/mzaf_1384594585520130409.std.aac.p.m4a","description":"A beautiful and provocative love story between two unlikely people and the hard-won relationship that elevates them above the Midwestern meth lab backdrop of their lives. <br /><br />As the daughter of a drug dealer, Wavy knows not to trust people, not even her own parents.

And if they do it right, we believe them. We believe that wine tastes better in a $20 glass than a $1 glass. We believe that an $80,000 Porsche Cayenne is vastly superior to a $36,000 VW Touareg, which is virtually the same car. We believe that $225 Pumas will make our feet feel better, and look cooler, than $20 no-names... \n<i>and believing it makes it true</i>. \n<br /> Successful marketers don't talk about features or even benefits. Instead, they tell a story. A story we want to believe.<br /><br /> This is a book about doing what consumers demand; painting vivid pictures that they choose to believe. Every organization, from nonprofits to car companies, from political campaigns to wineglass blowers, must understand that the rules have changed (again). In an economy where the richest have an infinite number of choices (and no time to make them), every organization is a marketer and all marketing is about telling stories.<br /><br /> Marketers succeed when they tell us a story that fits our worldview, a story that we intuitively embrace and then share with our friends. Think of the Dyson vacuum cleaner or the iPod.<br /><br /> But beware: If your stories are inauthentic, you cross the line from fib to fraud. Marketers fail when they are selfish and scurrilous, when they abuse the tools of their trade and make the world worse. That's a lesson learned the hard way by telemarketers and Marlboro.<br /><br /> This is a powerful book for anyone who wants to create things people truly want as opposed to commodities that people merely need."},{"wrapperType":"audiobook","artistId":364545521,"collectionId":1428147174,"artistName":"Martha Wells","collectionName":"All Systems Red","collectionCensoredName":"All Systems Red","artistViewUrl":"https://books.apple.com/us/author/martha-wells/id364545521?uo=4","collectionViewUrl":"https://books.apple.com/us/audiobook/all-systems-red/id1428147174?uo=4","artworkUrl60":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music118/v4/ec/47/c8/ec47c8c2-e1f8-aaaf-e643-cd2fd4271844/9781501977824_cover.jpg/60x60bb.jpg","artworkUrl100":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music118/v4/ec/47/c8/ec47c8c2-e1f8-aaaf-e643-cd2fd4271844/9781501977824_cover.jpg/100x100bb.jpg","collectionPrice":9.99,"collectionExplicitness":"notExplicit","trackCount":1,"copyright":"© 2017 Recorded Books","country":"USA","currency":"USD","releaseDate":"2017-10-20T07:00:00Z","primaryGenreName":"Sci-Fi & Fantasy","previewUrl":"https://audio-ssl.itunes.apple.com/itunes-assets/AudioPreview113/v4/a4/ab/1e/a4ab1e8d-cd35-404a-bad8-c087864991b9/mzaf_1984528898514986534.std.aac.p.m4a","description":"<i>All Systems Red</i> is the tense first science fiction adventure novella in Martha Wells' series The Murderbot Diaries.

We hear the limousine confessions of a celebrated foundation boss; witness an American president hem and haw about his plutocratic benefactors; and attend a cruise-ship conference where entrepreneurs celebrate their own self-interested magnanimity. <br /><br />Giridharadas asks hard questions: Why, for example, should our gravest problems be solved by the unelected upper crust instead of the public institutions it erodes by lobbying and dodging taxes? He also points toward an answer: Rather than rely on scraps from the winners, we must take on the grueling democratic work of building more robust, egalitarian institutions and truly changing the world.

They'll adjust their expectations to fit human nature and replace perpetual anger with refreshing humility and gratitude.<br /><br />Through the author's winsome, humorous, and conversational style, this book doesn't add another thing to do on a stressed-out person's ever-growing list. <i>Unoffendable</i> actually seeks to lift religious burdens from our backs and allow us to experience the joy of gratitude, perhaps for the first time, every single day of our lives."},{"wrapperType":"audiobook","artistId":2023981,"collectionId":20082682,"amgArtistId":203,"artistName":"Dennis Miller","collectionName":"Still Ranting After All These Years (Abridged Nonfiction)","collectionCensoredName":"Still Ranting After All These Years (Abridged Nonfiction)","artistViewUrl":"https://books.apple.com/us/author/dennis-miller/id2023981?uo=4","collectionViewUrl":"https://books.apple.com/us/audiobook/still-ranting-after-all-these-years-abridged-nonfiction/id20082682?uo=4","artworkUrl60":"https://is5-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music/y2004/m08/d05/h00/s05.zviolaqu.jpg/60x60bb.jpg","artworkUrl100":"https://is5-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music/y2004/m08/d05/h00/s05.zviolaqu.jpg/100x100bb.jpg","collectionPrice":14.99,"collectionExplicitness":"notExplicit","trackCount":1,"copyright":"© 2004 HarperAudio","country":"USA","currency":"USD","releaseDate":"2004-07-15T07:00:00Z","primaryGenreName":"Comedy","previewUrl":"https://audio-ssl.itunes.apple.com/itunes-assets/AudioPreview123/v4/b0/60/68/b0606809-7573-9674-d328-3f0abd9e3f70/mzaf_6295251891678218267.std.aac.p.m4a","description":"If you thought Dennis Miller was done ranting, guess again.

But how can you stay still when someone is pounding your face into the concrete pavement?<br /><br />There were witnesses: Quinn Collins—a varsity basketball player and Rashad’s classmate who has been raised by Paul since his own father died in Afghanistan—and a video camera. Soon the beating is all over the news and Paul is getting threatened with accusations of prejudice and racial brutality. Quinn refuses to believe that the man who has basically been his savior could possibly be guilty. But then Rashad is absent. And absent again. And again. And the basketball team—half of whom are Rashad’s best friends—start to take sides. As does the school. And the town.

Time </b>i<b>s not. Become financially independent as fast as possible.</b></b><br /><br />In 2010, 24-year old Grant Sabatier woke up to find he had $2.26 in his bank account. Five years later, he had a net worth of over $1.25 million, and CNBC began calling him \"the Millennial Millionaire.\" By age 30, he had reached financial independence. Along the way he uncovered that most of the accepted wisdom about money, work, and retirement is either incorrect, incomplete, or so old-school it's obsolete.<br /><br /><i>Financial Freedom</i> is a step-by-step path to make more money in less time, so you have more time for the things you love. It challenges the accepted narrative of spending decades working a traditional 9 to 5 job, pinching pennies, and finally earning the right to retirement at age 65, and instead offers readers an alternative: forget everything you've ever learned about money so that you can actually live the life you want.<br /><br />Sabatier offers surprising, counter-intuitive advice on topics such as how to:<br /><b><br />*</b>&#xa0;&#xa0;Create profitable side hustles that you can turn into passive income streams or full-time businesses<br /><b>*</b>&#xa0;&#xa0;Save money without giving up what makes you happy<br /><b>*</b>&#xa0;&#xa0;Negotiate more out of your employer than you thought possible<br /><b>*</b>&#xa0;&#xa0;Travel the world for less<br /><b>*</b>&#xa0;&#xa0;Live for free--or better yet, make money on your living situation<br /><b>*</b>&#xa0;&#xa0;Create a simple, money-making portfolio that only needs minor adjustments<br /><b>*</b>&#xa0;&#xa0;Think creatively--there are so many ways to make money, but we don't see them.<br /><br />But most importantly, Sabatier highlights that, while one's ability to make money is limitless, one's time is not. There's also a limit to how much you can save, but not to how much money you can make. No one should spend precious years working at a job they dislike or worrying about how to make ends meet. Perhaps the biggest surprise: You need less money to \"retire\" at age 30 than you do at age 65.<br /><br /><i>Financial Freedom</i> is not merely a laundry list of advice to follow to get rich quick--it's a practical roadmap to living life on one's own terms, as soon as possible."},{"wrapperType":"audiobook","artistId":2765976,"collectionId":2128038,"amgArtistId":267017,"artistName":"William Shakespeare, Edgar Allan Poe & Samuel Taylor Coleridge","collectionName":"The Best Poems of All Time, Volume 1 (Abridged Nonfiction)","collectionCensoredName":"The Best Poems of All Time, Volume 1 (Abridged Nonfiction)","artistViewUrl":"https://books.apple.com/us/author/william-shakespeare/id2765976?uo=4","collectionViewUrl":"https://books.apple.com/us/audiobook/the-best-poems-of-all-time-volume-1-abridged-nonfiction/id2128038?uo=4","artworkUrl60":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music/y2003/m08/d07/h16/s02.zuaqigxo.jpg/60x60bb.jpg","artworkUrl100":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music/y2003/m08/d07/h16/s02.zuaqigxo.jpg/100x100bb.jpg","collectionPrice":5.99,"collectionExplicitness":"notExplicit","trackCount":1,"copyright":"© 2001 Hachette Audio","country":"USA","currency":"USD","releaseDate":"2001-03-20T08:00:00Z","primaryGenreName":"Drama & Poetry","previewUrl":"https://audio-ssl.itunes.apple.com/itunes-assets/AudioPreview113/v4/e9/60/f0/e960f02d-f0ab-2218-e1d8-91e20993be7e/mzaf_4392457698504795503.std.aac.p.m4a","description":"This perfect poetry companion brings the words of the world's favorite poets to life.

And how can managers at any level build and sustain a profitable, vibrant work-group culture of their own? <br /><br />These leading workplace experts teamed up with research giant Towers Watson to analyze an unprecedented 300,000-person study, and they made a groundbreaking finding: managers of the highest-performing work groups create a “culture of belief”. In these distinctive workplaces, people believe in their leaders and in the company’s vision, values, and goals. Employees are not only engaged but also enabled and energized (termed the three Es), which leads to astonishing results—average annual revenues three times higher than for organizations lacking such a positive culture. And this was true during a period that included this most recent recession. <br /><br />Based on their extensive consulting experience and in-depth interviews with leaders and employees at exceptional companies, such as American Express, Cigna, Avis Budget, Pepsi Bottling, and Hard Rock, the authors present a simple seven-step road map for creating a culture of belief: define a burning platform; create a customer focus; develop agility; share everything; partner with your talent; root for each other; and establish clear accountability. <br /><br />Delving into specific how-tos for each step, they share eye-opening stories of exceptional leaders in action, vividly depicting just how these powerful methods can be implemented by any manager. <i>All In</i> draws on cutting-edge psychology and all of the creative genius that have made Gostick and Elton a must-read for leaders worldwide. This vital resource will empower managers everywhere to inspire a new level of commitment and performance."},{"wrapperType":"audiobook","artistId":1424049559,"collectionId":1424049024,"amgArtistId":1115822,"artistName":"Cormac McCarthy","collectionName":"All the Pretty Horses: The Border Trilogy, Book 1","collectionCensoredName":"All the Pretty Horses: The Border Trilogy, Book 1","artistViewUrl":"https://books.apple.com/us/author/cormac-mccarthy/id1424049559?uo=4","collectionViewUrl":"https://books.apple.com/us/audiobook/all-the-pretty-horses-the-border-trilogy-book-1/id1424049024?uo=4","artworkUrl60":"https://is5-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music114/v4/21/ff/c8/21ffc8e6-2a66-7009-fece-8fb666339d44/9781470381622_cover.jpg/60x60bb.jpg","artworkUrl100":"https://is5-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music114/v4/21/ff/c8/21ffc8e6-2a66-7009-fece-8fb666339d44/9781470381622_cover.jpg/100x100bb.jpg","collectionPrice":19.99,"collectionExplicitness":"notExplicit","trackCount":1,"copyright":"© 1992 Recorded Books","country":"USA","currency":"USD","releaseDate":"1992-01-01T08:00:00Z","primaryGenreName":"Fiction","previewUrl":"https://audio-ssl.itunes.apple.com/itunes-assets/AudioPreview114/v4/21/19/97/2119977f-c210-905d-65e9-538cf6386135/mzaf_610713698420044404.std.aac.p.m4a","description":"Cormac McCarthy is a quiet, unassuming presence in American fiction today, but like the slow, measured voices of many of his characters, he speaks with an authority and conviction that demands an audience. All the Pretty Horses, McCarthy's sixth novel, is a cowboy odyssey for modern times. Set in the late 1940s, it features the travels and toils of a 16-year-old East Texan named John Grady Cole, caught in the agonizing purgatory between adolescence and adulthood.<br /><br />At the start of the novel, Cole's grandfather has just died, his parents have permanently separated, and the family ranch, upon which he had placed so many boyish hopes, has been sold. Rootless and increasingly restive, Cole leaves Texas, accompanied by his friend Lacey Rawlins, and begins a journey across the vaquero frontier into the badlands of northern Mexico. In spite of its hard realities and spare telling, <i>All the Pretty Horses</i> is a lyrical and richly romantic story, chronicling—along with the erosion of the frontier—the loss of an era."},{"wrapperType":"audiobook","artistId":28398687,"collectionId":1522397397,"artistName":"Stuart Stevens","collectionName":"It Was All a Lie: How the Republican Party Became Donald Trump (Unabridged)","collectionCensoredName":"It Was All a Lie: How the Republican Party Became Donald Trump (Unabridged)","artistViewUrl":"https://books.apple.com/us/author/stuart-stevens/id28398687?uo=4","collectionViewUrl":"https://books.apple.com/us/audiobook/it-was-all-a-lie-how-the-republican-party-became/id1522397397?uo=4","artworkUrl60":"https://is4-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music115/v4/13/46/70/1346707b-717d-ba57-01f2-d238cd6ea9ea/9780593172315.d.jpg/60x60bb.jpg","artworkUrl100":"https://is4-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music115/v4/13/46/70/1346707b-717d-ba57-01f2-d238cd6ea9ea/9780593172315.d.jpg/100x100bb.jpg","collectionPrice":12.99,"collectionExplicitness":"notExplicit","trackCount":1,"country":"USA","currency":"USD","releaseDate":"2020-08-04T07:00:00Z","primaryGenreName":"Nonfiction","previewUrl":"https://audio-ssl.itunes.apple.com/itunes-assets/AudioPreview125/v4/43/6f/80/436f80bf-6327-09dd-f932-f1c133cc66eb/mzaf_2418256548445985792.std.aac.p.m4a","description":"<b><i>NEW YORK TIMES</i> BESTSELLER&#xa0;•&#xa0;From the most successful Republican political operative of his generation, a searing, unflinching, and deeply personal exposé of how his party became what it is today<br /><br />“A blistering tell-all history.

He knows the GOP as intimately as anyone in America, and in this new book he offers a devastating portrait of a party that has lost its moral and political compass.<br /><br />This is not a book about how Donald J. Trump hijacked the Republican Party and changed it into something else. Stevens shows how Trump is in fact the natural outcome of five decades of hypocrisy and self-delusion, dating all the way back to the civil rights legislation of the early 1960s. Stevens shows how racism has always lurked in the modern GOP's DNA, from Goldwater's opposition to desegregation to Ronald Reagan's welfare queens and states' rights rhetoric. He gives an insider's account of the rank hypocrisy of the party's claims to embody \"family values,\" and shows how the party's vaunted commitment to fiscal responsibility has been a charade since the 1980s. When a party stands for nothing, he argues, it is only natural that it will be taken over by the loudest and angriest voices in the room."},{"wrapperType":"audiobook","artistId":2070352,"collectionId":1439477399,"artistName":"Mary Higgins Clark & Alafair Burke","collectionName":"All Dressed in White (Unabridged)","collectionCensoredName":"All Dressed in White (Unabridged)","artistViewUrl":"https://books.apple.com/us/author/mary-higgins-clark/id2070352?uo=4","collectionViewUrl":"https://books.apple.com/us/audiobook/all-dressed-in-white-unabridged/id1439477399?uo=4","artworkUrl60":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music128/v4/64/e7/42/64e742d7-075a-bf17-79ff-896595ee90e2/9781442388277.jpg/60x60bb.jpg","artworkUrl100":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music128/v4/64/e7/42/64e742d7-075a-bf17-79ff-896595ee90e2/9781442388277.jpg/100x100bb.jpg","collectionPrice":12.99,"collectionExplicitness":"notExplicit","trackCount":1,"country":"USA","currency":"USD","releaseDate":"2015-11-17T08:00:00Z","primaryGenreName":"Mysteries & Thrillers","previewUrl":"https://audio-ssl.itunes.apple.com/itunes-assets/AudioPreview113/v4/53/c8/64/53c864f5-f199-7ef5-8ea0-10c50d604dec/mzaf_6604237218575088267.std.aac.p.m4a","description":"<b>The second in the thrilling <i>New York Times</i> bestselling series from Mary Higgins Clark and Alafair Burke, follows television producer Laurie Moran as she investigates the cold case of a bride who went missing days before her wedding.</b><br /><br />Five years ago, Amanda Pierce was excitedly preparing to marry her college sweetheart.

Mukherjee recounts centuries of discoveries, setbacks, victories, and deaths, told through the eyes of his predecessors and peers, training their wits against an infinitely resourceful adversary that, just three decades ago, was thought to be easily vanquished in an all-out “war against cancer.” The book reads like a literary thriller with cancer as the protagonist.<br /><br />Riveting, urgent, and surprising, <i>The Emperor of All Maladies </i>provides a fascinating glimpse into the future of cancer treatments.

Nicole “Coco” Martin is destined to have it all. As the only child of doting and successful parents, she has been given every opportunity in life. Having inherited her mother’s stunning beauty and creativity, along with her father’s work ethic and diligence, she has the world at her feet. Her graduation from Columbia is fast approaching, and with it the summer job of her dreams working at a magazine. Between work, leisurely weekends at her family’s home in Southampton, and spending as much time as possible with her best friend, Sam, life couldn’t be better—until tragedy strikes. Coco’s beloved parents are killed in a terrorist attack while on vacation in France.  Now devastated and alone, Coco must find a way to move forward and make her way in the world without the family she loved. Determined to forge her own path and make her parents proud, Coco pursues her dreams, dazzled by exciting opportunities that come her way. Her goals are to think outside the box—and always play by her own rules. As she finds herself drawn to charismatic, fascinating men, each relationship will teach Coco new lessons, some delightful, some painful. She will come to realize what matters, and how strong she truly is—and in the end, she will discover herself.  Richly exploring one woman’s poignant journey through life, All That Glitters is a compelling tale of challenges, heartbreak, discovery, and triumph, a powerful reminder that all that glitters is not the essence of life. And what is truly worth having was right there in our hands all along."},{"wrapperType":"audiobook","artistId":121982,"collectionId":265480267,"amgArtistId":2907,"artistName":"Bob Marley, Bob Saget, Charles Fleischer, Daniel Tosh, Gary Gulman, Ian Edwards, Jerry Diner, Jim Jefferies, Jo Koy, Mike Marino, Norm McDonald, Sebastian & Tom Dreesen","collectionName":"Laugh Factory Vol. 23 of All Access With Dom Irrera - Best of Vol. 2","collectionCensoredName":"Laugh Factory Vol. 23 of All Access With Dom Irrera - Best of Vol. 2","artistViewUrl":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/bob-marley/121982?uo=4","collectionViewUrl":"https://books.apple.com/us/audiobook/laugh-factory-vol-23-of-all-access-with-dom-irrera/id265480267?uo=4","artworkUrl60":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music/7d/2c/56/mzi.ycgtbxrh.jpg/60x60bb.jpg","artworkUrl100":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music/7d/2c/56/mzi.ycgtbxrh.jpg/100x100bb.jpg","collectionPrice":1.99,"collectionExplicitness":"notExplicit","trackCount":1,"copyright":"© 2003 Laugh Factory IMG Media, LLC","country":"USA","currency":"USD","releaseDate":"2003-04-28T07:00:00Z","primaryGenreName":"Programs & Performances","previewUrl":"https://audio-ssl.itunes.apple.com/itunes-assets/AudioPreview123/v4/a3/0f/2e/a30f2ea9-ffc6-65ad-079e-bb37e19c9ff9/mzaf_1295641710222498407.std.aac.p.m4a","description":"A special \"best of\" presentation from Volumes 11 through 20.<br />\n\n<b>Vol. 11</b><br />\nIntro: Tom Dreesen<br />\nTom Dreesen<br />\nCharles Fleischer Stand-up/Interview<br /><br />\n\n<b>Vol. 12</b><br />\nMike Marino Introduction<br />\nMike Marino<br />\nGary Gulman<br />\nGary Gulman Interview<br /><br />\n\n<b>Vol. 13</b><br />\nJerry Diner<br /><br />\n\n<b>Vol. 14</b><br />\nNorm McDonald<br />\nNorm McDonald Interview<br />\nIan Edwards<br /><br />\n\n<b>Vol. 15</b><br />\nJim Jefferies<br />\nJim Jefferies Interview<br /><br />\n\n<b>Vol. 16</b><br />\nJo Koy<br /><br />\n\n<b>Vol. 17</b><br />\nBob Marley Introduction<br />\nBob Marley<br /><br />\n\n<b>Vol. 18</b><br />\nDom Irrera / Bob Saget benefit<br />\nBob Saget Interview<br />\nBob Saget Stand-up<br /><br />\n\n<b>Vol. 19</b><br />\nSebastian<br /><br />\n\n<b>Vol. 20</b><br />\nDaniel Tosh"},{"wrapperType":"audiobook","artistId":1473900248,"collectionId":1481281377,"artistName":"Nikki R.

He begins by taking to task the perception of urban youth of color as unteachable, and he challenges educators to embrace and respect each student's culture and to reimagine the classroom as a site where roles are reversed and students become the experts in their own learning. <br /><br />Putting forth his theory of reality pedagogy, Emdin provides practical tools to unleash the brilliance and eagerness of youth and educators alike - both of whom have been typecast and stymied by outdated modes of thinking about urban education. With this fresh and engaging new pedagogical vision, Emdin demonstrates the importance of creating a family structure and building communities within the classroom, using culturally relevant strategies like hip-hop music and call-and-response, and connecting the experiences of urban youth to indigenous populations globally. Merging real stories with theory, research, and practice, Emdin demonstrates how by implementing the \"Seven C's\" of reality pedagogy in their own classrooms, urban youth of color benefit from truly transformative education. <br /><br />Lively, accessible, and revelatory, <i>For White Folks Who Teach in the Hood...and the Rest of Y'all Too</i> is the much-needed antidote to traditional top-down pedagogy and promises to radically reframe the landscape of urban education for the better."}]
